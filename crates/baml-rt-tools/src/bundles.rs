//! Tool bundle type system
//!
//! Bundles are represented as Rust types for compile-time type safety.
//! Each bundle implements `BundleType` to provide its metadata.

///
/// impl BundleType for Support {
///     const NAME: &'static str = "support";
///     fn description() -> &'static str {
///         "Support tools for basic operations"
